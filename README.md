## RFM Analysis 
RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is indeed a powerful technique for customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how each component of RFM analysis contributes to understanding customer value:

Recency (R): measures how recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who purchased recently are more likely to purchase again compared to those who haven't purchased in a while. Recency helps identify active and engaged customers.

Frequency (F): measures how often a customer makes a purchase within a given period. Frequent buyers are typically more loyal and likely to return. High frequency indicates strong customer engagement and satisfaction.

Monetary (M): measures how much money a customer has spent over a specific period. High monetary value indicates that the customer contributes significantly to revenue. Understanding which customers spend the most helps in targeting high-value customers for special promotions or loyalty programs.
